Following Learning to Fly (https://pwy.io/en/posts/learning-to-fly-pt3/), a
tutorial that introduces Rust through the building of a project to evolve feeding Boids.
Based on a simple application of a Genetic Algorithm to a weights of a Neural Network.

Captured here, mostly, so that I can switch among on multiple computers (home, portable, etc.).
